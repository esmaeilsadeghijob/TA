            A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. Personal computers are
            intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a computer expert or technician. Unlike large, costly minicomputers and mainframes,
            time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers.
            Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines. While personal computer
            users may develop their own applications, usually these systems run commercial software, free-of-charge software ("freeware"), which is most often proprietary,
            or free and open-source software, which is provided in "ready-to-run", or binary, form. Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently
            from the hardware or operating system manufacturers.[2] Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer, although end-user programming is still feasible. This contrasts with mobile systems,
            where software is often available only through a manufacturer-supported channel,[3] and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacture.
